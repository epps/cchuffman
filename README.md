# Coding Challenge #3 (Huffman Encoder/Decoder)

## Overview

This repo is my solution to John Crickett's [Coding Challenge #3 - Write Your Compression Tool!](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-huffman).

## Steps

- [x] Step 0: Project setup and download test text (_Les Mis√©rables_, by Victor Hugo from Project Gutenberg)
- [x] Step 1: Program should accept a filename and produce a frequency count of all characters in the file
- [x] Step 2: Build a binary tree from the frequencies calculated in Step #1
- [x] Step 3: Build a prefix-free table using the binary tree from Step #2
- [x] Step 4: Write the header section of the output file
- [ ] Step 5: Encode the file provided to the program using the prefix-free table and write it to the output file
- [ ] Step 6: Rebuild the prefix-free table from the output file's header section (reverse Step #4)
- [ ] Step 7: Decode the output file using the prefix-free table (reverse Step #5)
